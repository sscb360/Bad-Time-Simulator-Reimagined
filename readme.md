# Bad Time Simulator: Reimagined (Sans Fight)
This project is a clone of the sans fight from [Undertale](http://undertale.com/).
It was made with [Construct 2](https://www.scirra.com/construct2).
This version is not using the latest build of Bad Time Simulator & isn't planned to be updated unless the original creator of Bad Time Simulator: Reimagined (kckarnige) decides to do so.

Installation
------------
The web version can be played [here](https://kckarnige.is-a.dev/BadTimeRevamped), and the downloadable versions can be found [here](https://github.com/sscb360/BadTimeReimagined/releases).
